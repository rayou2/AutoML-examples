# AutoML-examples

## Experiment 1 (focus on classification)

The variable tested was TAP Level of Study 

Best Performing model was the Xgboost logloss at 0.175651

Baseline logloss is at 1.35895

Compared to Baseline, the Xgboost model was better

AUC values of 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 1.00, 0.98, 1.00. Also, the closer the AUC value to 1, the more accurate the model is

## Experiment 2 (focus on regression)

The variable tested was TAP College Code

Best performing model was the Xgboost rmse at 3.99492

Baseline rmse is at 2761.69

Compared to Baseline, the Xgboost model was better
